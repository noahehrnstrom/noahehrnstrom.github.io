# Noah Ehrnstrom

Hello and welcome to my website!

I'm a 16-year-old currently living in Norway. With a multitude of interests, ranging from playing drums to mushroom hunting, hacking is something that I really enjoy doing in my spare time, and which I also see as quite meaningful. Client-side code review is the hacking methodology I find the must fun, though I also hunt for other bugs such as Improper Access Control, Application Logic Errors and IDOR's.
